Three months since I started my India placement, 5 months since I started my Labs placement, that means the most unique/best 5 months of my working life have been and gone.

Do I feel different?

Yes.

Technically, 10 weeks programming in Java script allowed me to attain a deeper understanding of how systems work and developed my own take on how they **should** work. I was exposed to a full stack and had a chance to develop with a front end framework (React.js) for the first time. In the final few weeks of the placement I started looking into containers and Kubernetes, packaging a Node app into a container and throwing it to my colleague to run immediately via Docker was a particularly eye opening experience. In the final week, I got involved in the CI/CD pipeline and implemented a build step to audit our NPM packages and fail the build if vulnerabilities were found, outputting a report to our company IM chat. I feel like India just made me so much more confident in myself to write production ready code that is clean and solid.

Tesco-wise, it was great to finally understand how our office interact across the globe, as not only did I work in an Indian team I also engaged with a Polish counterpart team, I don't think most people in the UK are aware just how global Tesco is. I certainly feel like I have a much better perspective where our Indian colleagues are coming from at times, especially when they have no actual Tesco stores in India to go and engage with.

Personally, I had a chance to travel to 5 different states, Karnataka, Kerala, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh and I was exposed to a variety of cultures. Across all, there was a great inclusiveness and friendliness with the people we interacted with but there was an unwavering sense of patriotism for India, impressive in a country of 1 billion people. India is overwhelming, it is a barrage on the senses and I don't think I ever got quite used to it but now that I'm in the UK I can really appreciate when native Indians describe it as boring with crap food!

Overall, it's been a cracking year so far and I'm already 1 week back in my team at Contact, implementing a API client in Node, to allow colleagues to recieve their discount clubcards in the post!
