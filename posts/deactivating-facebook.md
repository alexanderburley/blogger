So a couple of weeks back I jumped on the bandwagon of deactivating my Facebook account. I pressed the magic button in my settings and and my account is now offline.

Why did I do it? I've actually been meaning to for a while and the Cambridge Analytica scandal was a nice excuse to jump on the bandwagon, my bags already packed. But what are the concrete reasons?

It all comes down to that word 'connect'. I feel that with Facebook it's like you're connecting to everything, which if you saw the memo [leaked by former FB VP Chamath Palihapitiya](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/facebook-former-executive-ripping-society-apart), has been their primary vision for a while. My profile is connected to groups, pages, acquintances, friends and family, apps and that really started to grate on me, and not even the constant supply of memes could balance it.

Example: A girl I know is my Facebook 'friend', a connection from high school, she had a kid a couple of years ago and I've seen that little bastard grow from bump to toddler and if I stay on facebook I'm gonna see his whole life through my computer screen! This just goes to show how my world has lost a large portion of its mystery and it's frustrating that every photo is on there, that everyone's life seems to be laid bare.

Of course I still use Instagram and Twitter but does that make me a hypocrite? With Instagram I get to see the specific highlight of what someone wants to put out, I don't directly see what they like or comment on. I get to put out my own content, and yeah I enjoy getting likes, a lot more that looking at memes and facebook albums.

Now I confess, I have made a new facebook profile, one with no friends and only two connections those being memberships in my university alumni group and my local sports club. The fact is that these groups are essential for organisation across age and location, without these groups I'm gonna have little exposure to my niche interests (Welwyn Warriors Lacrosse Club is a prime example).

With this new profile I get all the relevant social information but without that focus on an individual person's life.

I feel like when I attend my school reunion in ten years it'll be refreshing not to have had an magnifying glass to people's lives..that's if I manage to catch the invite!
