Week 2 of Bengalaru and I'm surviving, despite India being a very different place it's been a fabulous experience so far. From my home away from home in the suburb of Whitefield I've been having a fine time dipping in and out of Bangalore. The food is incredible although I confess to indulging on the pasta dishes served by my hotel while my stomach recovers from it's encounter with the local flora.

In all my life I've never experienced and probably will never will experience anything like the morning commute to work. The traffic is imbued with this chaotic order by which the only way to drive is to be reckless and trust that everyone else on the road has their heads screwed on. From U-turning infront of oncoming traffic or swerving to avoid the meandering cows, there is a knack to navigating the streets of Bangalore and I can only presume it's something the locals are born with.

Back in the UK, Tesco Technology is still trying to establish its identity, riding the line of being part of a corporate retail entity but trying to embrace the 'Tech' culture. Here in Bengalaru that 'Tech' culture is welcomed more strongly, flip-flops in the office being a common occurence. The campus itself is beautiful, walkways with garden canopies and stalls to buy drinking coconuts, the Stargate building even has a cricket ground built on top of it (sadly not the size of the Oval).

On the work front, I've been learning a full JS stack from MongoDB and an Express backend implementing GraphQL APIs right to the front end with React. On top of all that I've been working with containers and even had a shallow look at Kubernetes!

It's safe to say India is the most diverse and different country I've ever visited and I can't wait to visit many more of it's cities, with Mysore, Mangalore, Goa, Agra in the pipeline for weekend trips.

Onwards!
