Will be hosting this 'blog' of sorts on AWS, generated using my a simple CMS. Current project is designed to get familiar with writing frontend JS, even just simple CSS and HTML...although current styling is jacked from Github markdown css. I'm also trying to get a bit more familiar with AWS, linux server adminstration and NGINX. I dabbled a bit in docker to serve as some kind of deployment mechanism but it got a bit bitty and I am just deploying the blog manually at the moment. The deployment is literally just cloning the repository and copying it to a folder so shouldn't be too hard to implement.
