As part of the Tesco engineering graduate scheme, over the course of the year I get to take part in two unique placements, the first of which is within Labs - Tesco's R&D team and the second being the India placement which I'll talk more about next week when I arrive.

For the placement, twenty graduates get put into a room and assigned teams and given two weeks to come up with an idea by exploring a problem space anywhere in our business, with 4 weeks to actually build it. At last, I finally had a chance to put that 10 credit _Innovation Management_ module to good use!

My team and I ended up builidng Horus - an augmented reality application built for iOS 11 on the iPhone X and 8 models. We used Apple's ARKit framework to overlay images of products onto shelves in addition to training a TensorFlow model to recognise said products. By comparing the objects on the shelf to the overlay we were able to detect which products were out of place on the shelf in addition to viewing information about the products and how the shelf was meant to look,

Technically it was a great challenge and it was especially cool working with beta technology where we had to come up with our own solutions to problems as opposed to googling stack overflow posts from 2011. The product managements side of things was super cool, actually having that power and responsibility to direct the value of what we were making was great.

I would link to a video below but the presentation had some confidential info :(

Next week however, I'll be travelling to India to join the Aurora team where I'll be working with React and Node libraries.
