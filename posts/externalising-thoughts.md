Every human being has a million thoughts circling round their brains, causing stress, excitement and any one of the many feelings we all can feel. In the past year I've taken on a personal philosophy that these thoughts need to get out, that instead of managing life admin and feelings in your head, it should be written down on a piece of paper.

I've found that in the past year this process has kept down stress levels, made me more productive and also helped empower me to bring positive changes to my attitude (to life). Now instead of describing the proces I'm just going to list the various ways I externalise what's going on in my head.

1. **_[Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/get-started/)_** - A recent addition to my life admin organinsation but arguably becoming one of the most important. I'd describe this as a general life tracker. You can do anything with it, anyway you want. It could just be a glorified ToDo list but I now use BuJo for meal planning, gym plans and checking monthly routines and daily habits.

2. **_Personal Diary_** - For the personal things in life, this baby gets used for emotional thoughts that I just need to get out my head. It's been going strong for about 4 years but the university years shamefully write about two things, my girlfriend and lacrosse. Now I'm a bit older I'm trying to tease out the deeper feelings, what's making me happy and what gets me down and how I can get in and out of those states of mind.

3. **_This Blog_** - I've always liked writing, even if I'm not particularly great at it. Sometimes I just want to write about what I've learnt, perhaps so I don't forget it. I don't publicise this website anywhere, I've only put it on my LinkedIn so employers can see a bit more detail on what I've been up to at work.

4. **_Ledger_** - Every paycheck I write down in this book where it all goes and then move it. I keep track of how much I owe people and notes on irregularites in my account balances. After that I don't really think about my cash until the next pay day.

5. **_Apple Reminders_** - I keep lists upon lists that fluctuate too much to have to write and maintain them in my BuJo. Any item or object I want to buy I add it to a list and every pay day I try and tick a few off. I have 'Bands to Listen To', 'Clothes to Buy', 'Recipes to Cook', 'Books to Read'.

6. **_Twitter_** - OG social media, if I think of something funny that other people might enjoy? Tweet it.
